                <p>Amassive, 80-foot sign advertising the latest Hollywood attraction looms over drivers heading west on Wilshire Boulevard through Westwood.</p>


                 <p>Towering above the entertainment mecca ofLos Angeles, the colorful images cut a striking figure against the cold steel and concrete of the surrounding high-rises.</p>

                <p>In January, pedestrians were treated to an image plugging the much-awaited sequel to 2014’s instant classic, “Ride Along.”</p>

                <p>But under the outstretched right leg of Kevin Hart – midway through a flying karate kick – read a small peculiar one-sentence label.</p>

                <p>“Sky Posters: Creating and selling commercial pop culture posters, available inside.”</p>

                <p>The longer story behind that phrase is a muddled deep dive into the Los Angeles municipal systemthat has shaped the history of an otherwise nondescript West Los Angeles office building.</p>

                <p>So what’s in a wall? Well, it turns out it’s a complicated tale involving the timeless political themes of money, greed and, of course, a legal loophole or two.</p>

                <p>The Westwood Medical Plaza building started out simply enough. It was built in the early 1960s as one of noted local architect Paul Williams’ last commissions, according to the Los Angeles Conservancy. The building’s west wall was left intentionally windowless so that patients weren’t forced to look out into the Los Angeles National Cemetery while sitting at the examination table.</p>

                <p>But decades after the 12-story building’s construction, the white wall standing stark against the major urban vein of the Wilshire Corridor evolved into a valuable business opportunity for the building owners.</p>

                <p>The Muller Company, which purchased the building in 1995, pictured the wall as a blank canvas for lucrative advertisements – and decided to act on it.</p>

                <p>After striking a deal with Walt Disney Studios, the new owners commissioned commercial artist Mike McNeilly and his company, SkyTag, Inc., to create a mural for the upcoming re-release of “The Little Mermaid” in 1997.</p>

                <p>However, LA Councilman Mike Feuer blocked McNeilly’s efforts to gain legal permission for the advertisement, the painting was halted early into the process.</p>

                <p>Frustrated by the bureaucratic system as well as Feuer’s unflinching stance against what he considered billboard blight, McNeilly gave up on the legal route and turned to guerilla-style efforts in order to get his next project up, which would eventually land him into deeper trouble with the city.</p>

                <p>Playing the role of “The Man,” city officials arrested McNeilly two years after “The Little Mermaid” fiasco while he was painting a giant mural of the Statue of Liberty on the wall. At the time, he called it a tribute in honor of the veterans interred in the nearby cemetery.</p>

                <p>On his way down the building, the artist was surreptitiously able to paint a tear rolling down Lady Liberty’s face, a cheeky commentary on what he said was an infringement on his constitutional right to free expression.</p>

                <p>Less subtly, McNeilly returned to the scene after his arrest and pasted a colossal “censored” banner across the unfinished work.</p>

                <p>For his part, McNeilly has always maintained that he is purely an artist, exercising his First Amendment right to freedom of expression by dotting the landscape of West Los Angeles with all-American consumerist images through his company.</p>

                <p>“Look at my history,” McNeilly wrote in the June 2000 issue of the New Times L.A. “I’ve done this for years. For charities. For free. For political statements. And I’ve never charged anybody. But people don’t like to think, ‘You mean, there’s actually some crazy artist who actually does stuff for free?’”</p>

                <p>Westwood Community Council Chair Steve Sann sees McNeilly’s efforts a bit differently.</p>

                <p>“He’s not an artist – he’s a billboard businessman,” Sann said. “He’s a horrific perpetrator of supergraphics in the world and advertisesfrom space.”</p>

                <p>Sticking to his guns, McNeilly fought back against the charges, asserting his right to free expression of a noncommercial image. He later emerged victorious when a state appeals court sided with him and allowedLiberty image to remain in place.</p>

                <p>At face level, this may sound like the story of an innocent citizen standing up to an oppressive governmental force.</p>

                <p>A letter sent to the Los Angeles Times a few months before McNeilly’s court victory, however, ended up being oddly prescient.</p>

                <p>“Who could complain about something as patriotic as the Lady? Should his claim be upheld, though, I can pretty much guarantee that his next mural won’t be of his mom holding an apple pie. It’ll be right back to the lucrative beer, jeans, cars, etc. I do hope the courts won’t be taken in by this man’s patently money-grubbing ploy,” wrote South Pasadena resident Mike Kvammen in response to a story about the mural in the paper.</p>

                <p>Kvammen turned out to be slightly wrong in his prediction. Instead of beer, jeans or cars, it was Japanese bombers screaming out at drivers on Wilshire Boulevard.</p>

                <p> Not long after the court upheld McNeilly’s right to the memorial sign, he changed it again, this time as anadvertisement for the Ben Affleck flick, “Pearl Harbor.”</p>

                <p>Again, city officials ordered it be removed and threatened to hit McNeilly with fines or jail time if he refused.</p>

                <p>McNeilly and the building owners ended up capitulating, but a few months later, the events of 9/11 shocked the nation, and the wall in Westwood again became a symbolic battleground over liberty, law and public art. Following the attacks, McNeilly painted another mural on the wall featuring Lady Liberty and a firefighter in honor of the first responders.</p>

                <p> “This mural is a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of all the people who come and put their lives on the line in times of need,” McNeilly told the Los Angeles Times in 2001.</p>

                <p>The new artwork had city officials in a political bind, forcing them to commend the work’s patriotic and artistic merit, while having to reiterate its illegality. Eventually the piece was found in violation of city ordinance, and McNeilly was hit with more than two dozen code violations, each carrying up to $1,000 in fines, and six months in jail.</p>

                <p>Backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, McNeilly again initiated a First Amendment fight against the city and its charges for the second time in as many years.</p>

                <p>“There is no justification for such infringements on private,noncommercial speech,” said Dan Tokaji, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, in a statement at the time.</p>

                <p>City officials contended that McNeilly was trying to make his mark, except in a less artistic way – by opening up the  Wilshire Corridor to profitable billboard advertising.</p>

                 <div class="linebreak"> </div>

                 <p>The billboard industry is a force in LA politics to this very day, lobbying City Council for favorable regulation in the geographic center of the multibillion-dollar business. The efforts can be seen not too far away from UCLA,the seedy glitz and glamour of the Sunset Strip.</p>

                 <p>The industry’s influence was also evident in the 2001 racefor city attorney, which had major consequences for the controversial wall in Westwood.</p>

                 <p>On one side of the race was Feuer, who consistently stymied McNeilly and his efforts to get his work on the wall. Feuer was an attorney and politician who was known to rankle colleagues and special interest groups while acting as an outspoken advocate for West LA community members.</p>

                 <p>On the other side was Rockard “Rocky” Delgadillo, a native of East Los Angeles and a football star at HarvardUniversity. After returning to Los Angeles, he worked as an attorney at prominent law firms before being appointed as then-Mayor Richard Riordan’s deputy mayor for economic development.</p>

                 <p>Going into the race, Feuer had the advantage of greater

name recognition, but Delgadillo had a secret weapon up his

sleeve, spurred on by a recent court decision that approved

so-called “independent expenditures” in the race.</p>

<p>This allowed businesses and special interest groups to

contribute independently to campaigns if they followed a

series of regulations, including not coordinating with the

politicians beforehand.</p>

<p>“I think it was one of the first campaigns where we

started to see a high level of independent expenditures by

companies,” said Jean Merl, a former Los Angeles Times

reporter who covered the election.</p>

<p>In his time on the city council, Feuer had made enemies

of the billboard industry, consistently introducing new

legislation to tamp down on what he considered to be blight

on the Angeleno landscape.</p>

<p>The major companies in the billboard industry decided

to voice their displeasure toward Feuer to the tune of more

than $400,000, an amount virtually unheard of at the

time in a municipal election in the city. This staggering

contribution came in the form of dozens of signs and billboards advertising Delgadillo across Los Angeles.</p>

<p>“Clearly, the billboard companies didn’t like Mike Feuer,”

Merl said. “He would be the last person they’d want as city

attorney.”</p>

<p>Sann put it a little more bluntly, accusing Delgadillo of

being “owned and bought” by the billboard industry.</p>

<p>Billboard companies blanketed the city with Delgadillo’s

name and image, making the generally quiet race for city

attorney into a massive public affair. Delgadillo emerged

as the victor of the hard-fought runoff election with 52.4

percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Soon after Delgadillo took office, City Council passed a

ban on new “off-site” billboards, which are signs that direct

to businesses at other locations. This kicked off a wave

of lawsuits and litigation from sign companies wanting to

assert their right to make money off billboard space.</p>

<p>In his new role as city attorney, Delgadillo was able to

craft legal agreements that proved profitable to the sign

companies that supported him during his campaign.</p>

<p>While the biggest media attention was focused on a

2006 settlement with Clear Channel to convert 400 of

its billboards to more valuable digital billboards, a local

example was on the humble west wall of the Westwood

Medical Plaza building.</p>

<p>While the biggest media attention was focused on a

2006 settlement with Clear Channel to convert 400 of

its billboards to more valuable digital billboards, a local

example was on the humble west wall of the Westwood

Medical Plaza building.</p>

<p>One of these allegedly favorable settlements in 2003 ended

a series of back-and-forth lawsuits between McNeilly, the

building owners and the city over the right to advertise on

the wall.</p>

<p>“(Delgadillo) decided to sell Westwood down the river

instead of aggressively fighting billboard blight,” Sann said.</p>

<p>As part of the settlement, the building owners agreed to

put a public service message for one month out of the year

on the wall or pay the city the equivalent revenue. Industry

professionals estimate the cost of the posters at up to $3,000

a day in the busy throughway.</p>

<p>Additionally, the settlement gave the building owners the

right to use the wall as a place for advertisements as long as

it was solely used to promote “on-site” businesses.</p>

<div class="linebreak"> </div>

<p>That gets us to the origin story of the little phrase.

Under the terms of the settlement, only current tenants of

the building with “bona fide office space” conducting “bona

fide business” are allowed to place messages on the wall. </p>

<p>This meant that while McNeilly and the building owners

were given the right to put up new signs, they were also left

with a problem. The Westwood Medical Plaza building is

home to doctors’ offices, health stores, pharmacies and even

an LA Fitness, but it doesn’t house a movie production

studio or theater, which would be the legal way for the

profitable movie advertisements to qualify as an on-site sign.</p>

<p>So, McNeilly and the building owners decided to try

something else. They set up a company in the building

called Sky Posters, in effect creating an on-site business to

legally justify the advertisements on the wall.</p>

<p>The building’s fifth floor houses the company’s sparse

office space, which sells a limited amount of posters at

exorbitant prices. A normal 27-by-40 inch poster, which

retails for less than $20 on Amazon, instead sells for $110

there.</p>

<p>When asked for comment, an employee of the company

refused to stay and answer questions about the business,

instead choosing to leave the building via the parking lot.

The employee said that the business hours were from 9 a.m.

to 5 p.m. on weekdays, alluding to a settlement provision that required bona fide businesses to be open during normal

business hours. Multiple trips to the office, however, have

seen the office door locked in the afternoon with no response

to knocking.</p>

<p>The Sky Posters website features little additional

information, as well as a history section pretty much cribbed

word for word from the Wikipedia page for “poster.”</p>

<p>Dennis Hathaway, the president of the Coalition to Ban

Billboard Blight, said he’s been up to the location multiple

times over the years and does

of the business.</p>

<p>“In my view, it’s just a sham,” Hathaway said. “Quite

frankly, he’s thumbing his nose at the city.”</p>


                <p> <b style="color: #2199e8;"><span class="first">Kailua, Hawaii</span></b> – A quaint little town on the eastern shore of Oahu. It’s a place where one can always smell the ocean and is within walking distance of world-class beaches, a movie-esque town and the beautiful mountains. For Fisher, this is home.</p>



                <p>As a teenager, Fisher attended Hawai'i Baptist Academy, where he immediately found himself a head above the rest.</p>

                <p>“I was one of the tallest kids in the entire school; high and middle school,” Fisher said. “So head varsity coach Teoni Obrey kind of picked me out and really molded me into the player I am today.”
                </p>

                <p> Hawaii being as small as it is, Fisher and Ma’a naturally competed against each other in high school. </p>


                <p> “I remember playing him my senior year in the 'Iolani classic,” Fisher said. “(Ma'a's team), Punahou, had (former USC outside hitter and current UH transfer) Tui Tuileta, Kupono Fey and a bunch of other guys who were just good. And it was me, my little brother and then just a random group of guys. You would look at us and think, 'How are these guys on the same court as Punahou?'” </p>

                <p> HBA ended up taking a set from Punahou School, but that was all it would get. Regardless, it was a major upset that HBA was able to take even a single set.</p>


                <p>As Fisher progressed, he began to excel at the club volleyball level.</p>

                <p>From the time Fisher was 14, he and the University of Hawai'i outside hitter Kupono Fey were teammates. Their club team did exceptionally well, especially during their 18’s year. Eventually, Fisher moved up to the USA A2 program, only a step under the junior national team.</p>

                <p>Having no major familial ties to volleyball, Fisher has started his own dynasty.</p>

                <p>“Then, in turn, (coach Obrey) has taken my little brother and sister and molded them into players,” Fisher said. “So I think we’re starting to become a volleyball family.”</p>

                <p> <b style="color: #2199e8;">Kane'ohe, Hawaii </b> — Micah Ma’a’s home is a town that sits adjacent to Kailua. Despite their geographical similarities, the two towns have very different feels. Instead of Whole Foods, Kane'ohe displays its own brand of mom-and-pop stores as well as major chains where everybody knows your name – rather than first-generation Hawaii residents, many old, local families inhabit the gentle green valley.</p>



                <p>Ma’a, like his town, has had a far different story than his neighbor.</p>



                <p>His father, Pono Ma’a, and mother, Lisa Strand Ma’a both played at the University of Hawai'i in the '80s.</p>

                <p>Lisa helped lead the UH Wahine to their first national championships in 1982 and 1983 and Pono was a two-time All-American, the first member of the UH Warrior’s 1,000-kill club. He would further etch his name into the record books, setting single-season records in a trio of categories in 1986.</p>



                <p>After college, both enjoyed fruitful professional careers on the court and the beach.</p>

                <p>Ma’a’s older sister also saw high-level success in volleyball. Misty Ma’a was Hawaii’s Gatorade State Player of the Year in 2010 and went on to play at the University of Miami on a scholarship.</p>


                <p>With a plethora of volleyball greats around him, Ma’a credited his family for getting him started in the sport.</p>


               <p>“My mom was my first coach actually. She threw me on my older sister’s team when I was about seven,” Ma’a said. “I was the only boy so I was just a rascal and I didn’t really care much. But then it slowly became more important to my family and me. Then at about 10, we started our first club team with my dad coaching."</p>

                <div class="pullquote">
                    <p>“Hawaii will always be my favorite place on Earth. No matter how special anywhere else I go is ... Hawaii is the place of my ancestors and my people.”</p><p><cite> Micah Ma’a</cite>

                </div>


                <p>Ever since those early beginnings up until his college days, Ma'a's dad was the only club coach he ever had, helping him to seven national championships on those teams.</p>

                <p>But it wasn’t only family that helped the young Ma’a along. Being surrounded by great volleyball means you also meet great volleyball players outside of the family.</p>

                <p>“Tui Tuileta and (Stanford libero) Evan Enriques always drove me to be much better at volleyball than I probably ever would’ve pushed myself,” Ma’a said. “They’ve always been like my older brothers.”</p>

                <p>Ma’a spent most of his schooling years on the campus of academic and athletic powerhouse, Punahou. All the while Ma'a played, Punahou's volleyball teams would stack up to expectation.</p>

                <p>Even though their high school matchup was years ago, Fisher still enjoys jabbing at Ma'a a little.</p>

                <p>“I remember we played them in the 'Iolani classic and they stole a set,” Ma’a said. “Our coach was just irate; he was not having it. And Fisher still talks about it now like, ‘Oh dude, remember how we beat you guys in that one set,’ like he did all the work … But it was all good fun.”</p>

                <p> <b style="color: #2199e8;"><span class="first">Westwood, California</span></b> — When it came to choosing a college, volleyball opened the doors for both of them. But for Fisher, it was the influence of coaches that pushed him through.</p>

                <p>Recruitment started during Fisher's sophomore year and consisted of schools calling to express interest.</p>

                <p>Obrey pulled Fisher aside to give him the news, but Fisher wasn’t sure which opportunity to run with.</p>


                <p>“I was like, ‘That’s pretty cool, I never thought I’d do that,'” Fisher said. “So I asked him, ‘What do you think, where do you think I should go?’ and he told me to go wherever John Speraw goes because he’s the best coach right now.”</p>


                <p>At that time, Speraw was the coach at UC Irvine. But once Speraw took the job at UCLA in 2012, that’s when things turned very serious.</p>

                <p>“I saw Fisher when I was in Irvine,” Speraw said. “Then I got the job at UCLA and he was the first guy we started recruiting.”</p>

                <p>Fisher’s transition to college wasn’t an easy one, but the camaraderie of the volleyball team made it easier.</p>

                <p>“In Hawaii, I was a big fish in a small pond, but you get up here and it’s an ocean basically,” Fisher said. “We’ve always just tried to make everyone feel like they don’t need to do anything to be a part of the team, you’re already in the family, you just got to go play volleyball."</p>


                <p>As a freshman, Ma'a's college transition is still an ongoing process.</p>

                <p>“It’s been easier than I’ve expected because of the fact that our team is super close,” Ma’a said. “When I moved up here I knew I’d miss my family – I knew I’d miss the weather and beaches – but the main thing was my family. But that void has been filled by my team … From day one, I felt like I had someone always by my side – well, actually, 17 of them.”</p>

                <p>Speraw has tried to foster this type of welcoming environment since the beginning.</p>

                <p>“I try very hard to break down old hierarchies,” Speraw said. “I try very hard to be respectful, teach and communicate with everybody as best I can. And I think the way you act, the way you behave and the example you set is ultimately the behavior pattern your team will emulate.”</p>

                <p><p> <b style="color: #2199e8;">Despite the thousands of miles</b> now separating the pair of Bruins from their families, their love for Hawaii hasn't been dampened.</p>

                <p>“I can’t imagine living anywhere else or growing up anywhere else,” Fisher said. “People in Hawaii are just so genuinely kind and they care about you – not that the people on the mainland aren’t like that, but it’s just a whole different feel when you’re in Hawaii. And growing up in a place like that is really special; I’m grateful that my parents raised me in Hawaii.”</p>

                <p>Volleyball, a constant in Fisher and Ma’a’s lives, is just one of the many ties that bring the two together.</p>

                <p>“Hawaii will always be my favorite place on Earth,” Ma’a said. “No matter how special anywhere else I go is, I won’t let myself say that it’s better than Hawaii just because Hawaii is the place of my ancestors and my people. And being Hawaiian is truly a huge privilege to me. I’m more than proud of being Hawaiian.”</p>
